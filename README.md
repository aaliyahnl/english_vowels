### Abstract
Vowels are a group of unobstructed phonemes that are produced between consonants. In English, vowels are defined by the position of the tongue during articulation. More specifically, this position is measured in terms of tongue height and tongue backness, which can be analyzed using formant analysis. The first formant (F1) corresponds to tongue height, while the second formant (F2) corresponds to tongue backness. Through this classification, vowels are often represented in a discrete, categorical system. Experimental psycholinguistic studies have supported this system, showing evidence that steady-state vowels are perceived categorically. However, within these categories, speakers exhibit variability in vowel production. Linguists have observed that this variability is patterned according to social factors, particularly a speakerâ€™s geographic location. Despite this, regional variation has not traditionally been used to explain differences in vowel production. Listeners are often able to resolve these variations during speech processing, but a clearer understanding of how regionality influences vowel production could enhance our comprehension of these processes. This study presents a comparative analysis of vowels produced by bilingual English speakers who have native knowledge of a Southeast Asian language. The data consists of recordings from nine speakers, taken from the Speech Accent Archive at George Mason University. Each speaker recited a 33-second script that contained thirteen English vowels, including eight monophthongs and five diphthongs. Formant values for tongue height (F1) and tongue backness (F2) were extracted using Praat software and plotted on a vowel chart. The results provide a detailed overview of vowel production in Southeast Asian varieties of English, with a particular focus on distinguishing formant characteristics. Future research should explore other regional varieties of English for comparison.
